This Solution Pattern demonstrates how to implement a container-native OpenAPI RESTful API without coding.

Container-native applications::
Applications that are designed to run in a containerised environment.

// This is taken right from https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
OpenAPI Specification::
A standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs. REST APIs allow both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

In this Solution Pattern you follow a design-first approach, based on the OpenAPI specification, to define a RESTful API that accepts a name parameter and echoes it back in the response body.
You then use the resulting Open API definition to generate the code for your API and deploy it in a containerised environment.

Following a design first approach to API development is self-documenting, and provides a clear API definition for partners and end-users of your API.
It also allows you to identify important design decisions prior to coding and deployment.
