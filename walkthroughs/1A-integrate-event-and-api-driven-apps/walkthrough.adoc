This Solution Pattern demonstrates a fault tolerant integration pattern that integrates a message driven architecture with a RESTful API architecture.

Message-oriented middleware (MOM)::
MOM allows you to implement an asynchronous, routable, and transformable message queue.

API-centric architecture::
Typically, a developer working on a back-end application implements a synchronous RESTful API to allow communication from other applications.

You may identify business value, as part of an application modernization effort, by integrating a message queue with an API.
This is not trivial, because of the conflicting underlying timing models. The data may require transformation to be usable.

This Solution Pattern consists of the following components:

* An Order Entry System, built with Node.js, that provides a RESTful API and a user interface to create order messages
* An Order Management System RESTful API, built with Red Hat Fuse, for querying and creating orders in an underlying PostgreSQL database
* An Order Management System user interface, built with Node.js, for visualising orders in the PostgreSQL database using the Fuse RESTful API


To create this integration, use link:{enmasse-url}[AMQ Online, window="_blank", id="wt1a_GS_enmasse-url"] and API connectors in link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="wt1a_GS_fuse-url"].

All of the applications and services used in this Solution Pattern are running on Red Hat OpenShift.

==  Creating an address in AMQ Online address space
:context: creating-connections

// tag::creating-api-connector[]

To route messages from the Order Entry System to the Order Management System, create an address in AMQ Online.

. Log into link:{enmasse-url}[AMQ Online, window="_blank", id="{context}-1"].
. Select *Addresses* from the left hand menu.

. Create a *requests* address:
.. Select the *Create* button to start the *Create new address* wizard.
.. Enter the following as the name:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
work-queue-requests
----
.. Select *queue* as the type and click *Next*.
.. Select *Small Queue* as the address plan and click *Next*.
.. Select *Create* to complete the wizard.

=== Creating an API Connector

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as Gmail and IRC.
You can extend Fuse Online with custom connectors, using either OpenAPI definitions (Swagger) or JAR files.
To create a connector for the Fuse RESTful API, register the OpenAPI definition as a *Customization*:

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="{context}-1"] console.
+
NOTE: You are not logging into the shared Fuse Online instance, available from the link:/[All services tab]. 
Starting this Solution Pattern provisioned an instance of Fuse Online which is not shared with other cluster users.

. Select *Customizations > API Client Connectors* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create API Connector* button to start the *API Client Connector* wizard.

. When prompted to *Upload OpenAPI Document*, select *Use a URL*:
.. Enter the following in the URL field:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="route-crud-host-url-connector"]
----
{route-orders-fuse-api-host}/openapi.json
----
This OpenAPI (swagger) file defines the API for querying and creating orders in the underlying PostgreSQL database.

.. Click *Next*.

. When prompted with *Review Actions*, select *Next*.

. When prompted with *Specify Security*, select *Next*.

. When prompted with *Review/Edit Connector Details*:
.. Enter the following in the *Name* field:
