= Writing Walkthroughs

How to get started with writing your own Walkthroughs using a simple markup language.

The webapp allows you write and publish your own walkthroughs to a cluster using:

* Asciidoc - a simple mark up language, similar to markdown
* git repo - push your asciidoc file to a git repo
* deploy web app - use openshift to redeploy your web app and view the new walkthrough

The simplest walkthrough file might look like:

----
= Demonstrating a custom walkthrough <1>

A short description for the walkthrough. <2>

== Doing a task <3>

=== Doing a subtask <4>

. Do this first: <5>
. Do this second: <5>
----

<1> Walkthrough title, you can only have one level 1 heading per file
<2> The first line of the introduction is displayed as a tag line for the walkthrough.
<3> A task contains one or more subtasks (level 3 headings)
<4> Subtasks are displayed on the task page
<5> Subtasks are numbered lists of steps the user must perform.

== Getting started

To get started with Walkthrough development you can either start from scratch or clone the template repository.

=== Downloading the template

The template contains the directory structure along with a sample walkthrough and manifest file.

. Clone the template repository
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/walkthrough-template.git
----

. Change to the `walkthrough-template` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd walkthrough-template
----


[type=verification]
Make sure you have a directory named `walkthrough-template` on your system containing a `walkthroughs` subdirectory.

[type=verificationFail]
Try downloading the link:https://github.com/integr8ly/walkthrough-template/archive/master.zip[zip] file and creating a repo.

=== Understanding the file structure

----
.
└── walkthroughs<1>
    ├── <Walkthrough ID> <2>
    │   ├── images <3>
    │   │   └── image.png
    │   ├── walkthrough.adoc <4>
    │   └── walkthrough.json <5>
    ├── Another walkthrough <2>
    └── Third walkthrough <2>
----

<1> This is a required directory. All walkthroughs are defined under `walkthroughs`.

<2> The directory name of a walkthrough. This is also displayed in the URL of the web app.

<3> All images for the walkthrough.

<4> *walkthrough.adoc* is where the content of the walkthrough is written in asciidoc format.
<5> *walkthrough.json* is the manifest file of the walkthrough where you can define extra dependencies.


If you do not have extra dependencies, use the following for your *walkthrough.json*:

[source,json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "repos": [],
    "serviceInstances": []
  }
}
----

=== Committing your walkthroughs to a remote repository

Typically, you push your changes to GitHub.

. Create a new remote repository and take note of the remote URL.

. Add the remote URL to your local clone.
+
[source,bash]
----
git remote add upstream <remote URL>
----

. Push your changes.
+
[source,bash]
----
git push -u upstream master
----

[type=verification]
Make sure you have a remote repository with the content you want to publish.

[type=verificationFail]
If you created files from a zip file instead of cloning, you need to initialize and commit the changes first.

[time=5]
== Adding a Preamble

The preamble describes your walkthrough. When a user opens a walkthrough they will first see an overview page with the contents of your preamble. The preamble should be the first section in your walkthrough.

* Introduce the preamble with a first level heading (`=`)
* The title of the preamble becomes the name of your walkthrough
* The preamble is followed by a short introductory paragraph that outlines the walkthrough in one or two sentences. This description is displayed in the card on the Overview page of the Webapp.

You can also add a second paragraph to the preamble. The second paragraph should have more content than the first paragraph, and it is displayed when a user clicks on the card.

=== Adding a preamble to the template

Using the repository you created in the first task:

. Edit the `walkthroughs/walkthrough.adoc` file.

. Change the title of the walkthrough, for example:
+
----
= My first Walkthrough
----

. Add an introductory paragraph to your preamble.

. Add another paragraph with more information about the walkthrough.

. Commit your changes.
+
----
git commit -am "add preamble"
----

. Push your changes to the remote repository.
+
----
git push upstream master
----

[type=verification]
Make sure that all your changes are in the remote repository.

[type=verificationFail]
Check your git credentials and ensure you pushed to the correct remote repository.


[time=5]
== Adding tasks

Walkthroughs are organized by tasks. A task is a single page in the Webapp.

Tasks are introduced by a second level heading (`==`).

=== Adding a task to the template

The template already contains a sample task; however, you can change it as follows:

. Edit the `walkthroughs/walkthrough.adoc` file.

. Change the task title, for example, `== My first task`

. The heading of a task can be followed by a short introductory paragraph of what the user is about to learn. 

. Tasks must have a time associated with them. This lets the user know how long the task will approximately take and is also displayed in the walkthrough overview.

. The template task already has a block attribute for the time. The syntax is always:
+
----
[time=<value>]
== My first task
----

. Save, commit, and push your changes.

. You need to trigger a redeploy of the Webapp to see the changes. To do this, open the link:{openshift-host}[Openshift Console] and find the *tutorial-web-app* deployment.

. Click the *Redeploy* button.

[type=verification]
After the redeploy, refresh the tab with your walkthrough. You should see the updated content.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the Webapp has finished redeployment and no errors occurred.

[time=5]
== Adding procedures

Tasks are divided into procedures. A procedure is a set of steps that need to be executed one after the other to achieve a goal. Procedures are introduced using a third level heading (`===`). You can add a paragraph describing the procedure the user is about to follow.

The steps in a procedure should be written using Asciidoc numbered lists. Prepend your steps with a `. ` to add them to a numbered list.

=== Adding a sample procedure

. The sample walkthrough already has a procedure. Change its name to *My first procedure*.

. Add a paragraph with a sentence describing your procedure.

. Add a numbered list:
+
----
. First step
. Second step
. Third step
----

. Save, commit and push your changes.

. Trigger a redeploy of the Webapp as you did in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that your Task has a number of steps.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the Webapp has finished redeployment and no errors occurred.

[time=5]
== Adding walkthrough resources

You can help users who follow your walkthrough. You can display helpful information and links on the right hand side panel of the Webapp. Resources are added using block attributes:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[type=walkthroughResource,serviceName=openshift]
.OpenShift
****
* link:{openshift-host}[Openshift Console, window="_blank"]
****
----

Setting `serviceName` is optional. If set to the name of a middleware service, an icon indicating the service status will be displayed next to the resource. For a list of default services, see link:https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app/blob/master/src/common/serviceInstanceHelpers.js[the value for DEFAULT_SERVICES].

Setting the `window="_blank"` parameter for a walkthrough resource link is also optional, but ensures that the target of the link displays in a separate browser tab. If omitted, the content of the target's link will replace the walkthrough content in the current browser tab.

Walkthrough resources must only be defined in the preamble section.


=== Adding a Walkthrough resource to the template

. At the end of the preamble section add the following resource:
+
----
[type=walkthroughResource]
.My resource
****
* link:https://google.com[Helpful link, window="_blank"]
****
----

. Save, commit and push your changes. Then trigger a redeployment of the Webapp like in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that the resource appears on the right hand side of the walkthrough overview as well as on the task page.

[type=verificationFail]
Make sure that you added the resource to the preamble section and that it uses a third level heading.

[time=5]
== Adding images

You can add images to any section of your walkthrough. Images should be placed in a subdirectory with the name *images*.

Add an image to your content using: `image::<path>[<alt text>, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]`

* `<alt text>` is a text alternative that will be displayed when the image can't be rendered
* `role="integr8ly-img-responsive"` this should be used for all images as it ensures that the correct styles are applied to the image

=== Adding an image to the template

. Create the *images* subdirectory inside your walkthrough directory

. Copy a .png or .jpg image into that directory

. Add the image to the preamble:
+
----
image::images/<name>[diagram, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
----

. Save, commit and push your changes. Then trigger a redeployment of the Webapp like in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that the image is displayed in the walkthrough overview.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the Webapp has finished redeployment and no errors occurred.

[time=5]
== Adding task resources

Task resources, like walkthrough resources, are used to display helpful information to the user on the right hand side of the Webapp. The difference is that, while Walkthrough resources are displayed on every task, task resources only appear in the task they were defined in.

They are added to task sections but don't have the `serviceName` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[type=taskResource]
.Useful links
****
* link:{openshift-host}[Openshift Console]
****
----

=== Adding a task resource to the template

. At the end of your Task section, add the following:
+
----
[type=taskResource]
.Useful links
****
* link:https://google.com[Task related link]
****
----

. Save, commit and push your changes. Then trigger a redeployment of the Webapp like in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that the task resource appears on your task, but not on the overview page.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the Webapp has finished redeployment and no errors occurred.

[time=10]
== Adding verifications

Every procedure in a task should have a verification. Verifications are used to make sure that the steps taken by the user were successful. They should be formulated as questions and the user can answer them with `Yes` or `No`.

As with resources, block attributes are used to define verifications

=== Adding a verification to our task

. At the end of the Procedure section, right after the numbered list add:
+
:verificationText: verification
[source,asciidoc,subs="attributes"]
----
[type={verificationText}]
Check that the dashboard of service X reports no errors.
----

. To provide a better feedback to users when something didn't go as planned you should use *verificationFail* blocks. They allow you to display text that will be displayed when the users answers the verification with `No`:

. After the verification block add:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
[type=verificationFail]
Try turning it off and on again.
----

. Save, commit and push your changes. Then trigger a redeployment of the Webapp like in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that the verification appears on the task. Check that you can click the *Next* button when answered *Yes* and that the fail text appears when answering *No*.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the verification has been added after the procedure section. It will be ignored in any other location.

[time=5]
== Using attributes

Attributes are used to make external variables accessible to the asciidoc. The syntax for using attributes is `{<attribute name>}`. Walkthroughs have access to a number of predefined attributes:

* If a middleware service defines a route you can access it via `{route-<route name>-host}`.

* The Openshift Console is available as `\{openshift-host}`.

Other attributes that are available to walkthrough authors are:

* Default attributes:
** OpenShift App Host: `\{openshift-app-host}`
** CodeReady Workspaces URL: `\{che-url}`.
** Fuse URL: `\{fuse-url}`
** Launcher URL: `\{launcher-url}`
** API Management URL: `\{api-management-url}`
** AMQ Online URL: `\{enmasse-url}`
** AMQ Online Broker URL: `\{enmasse-broker-url}`
** AMQ Online Credential Username: `\{enmasse-credentials-username}`
** AMQ Online Credential Password: `\{enmasse-credentials-password}`
* Custom attributes:
** NodeJS Frontend App Route (provisioned from walkthrough.json): `\{route-frontend-host}`

=== Adding a link to the Openshift Console

. Add another step to the numbered list in your Procedure:
+
----
. Click on link:{openshift-url}[Openshift Console]
----

. Save, commit and push your changes. Then trigger a redeployment of the Webapp like in the previous task.

[type=verification]
Check that the step is displayed as a link to the Openshift Console.

[type=verificationFail]
Check that the correct attribute has been used.

[time=10]
== Adding custom services to a walkthrough

As an advanced task, you can create services from the OpenShift catalog in the cluster. You can also link to the URLs associated with those services in your `walkthrough.adoc` file.

=== Finding the name of the service you want to provision

.Prerequisites

Some experience with the `oc` command. See task resources for more information.


. Log into the link:{openshift-url}[Openshift Console].

. Click your username in the top right corner and choose *Copy Login Command* from the menu.

. Log into the OpenShift CLI using the `oc` on your clipboard.

. Run the following command to list all the service names available from your cluster catalog:
+
----
oc get clusterserviceclasses -o custom-columns="Display Name (From Service Catalog):.spec.externalMetadata.displayName, Identifier (clusterServiceClassExternalName):.spec.externalName"
----
+
The output lists all the services available in two columns:
+
* Display Name (From Service Catalog)
* Identifier (clusterServiceClassExternalName)

. Choose the service you want to use, and note the value in the `Identifier (clusterServiceClassExternalName)` column.
+
For example, to use the `CakePHP + MySQL (Ephemeral)` service in your custom walkthrough, note the value `cakephp-mysql-example`.

=== Creating the service and determining the attribute name to use in the walkthrough

. Create a `walkthrough.json` with the following contents to provision the `cakephp-mysql-example` service:
+
----
{
    "dependencies": {
        "repos": [],
        "serviceInstances": [
            {
                "metadata": {
                    "name": "cakephp-mysql-example"
                },
                "spec": {
                    "clusterServiceClassExternalName": "cakephp-mysql-example",
                    "clusterServicePlanExternalName": "default"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----

. Publish your walkthrough using the `walkthrough.json` file above.
. Navigate the walkthrough to trigger the provisioning of the custom service, for example, the `cakephp-mysql-example` service.
. Log into the link:{openshift-url}[OpenShift Console].
. Navigate to the custom project in OpenShift.
The project is named using the pattern `<username>-<walkthrough-id>`.
. Open *Routes* from the *Applications* menu.
. Note the *Name* of the route you want to reference in your walkthrough tasks. For example, `cakephp-mysql-example`.

=== Editing the walkthrough

To use the attribute in a walkthrough:

. Edit the `walkthrough.adoc` file and use the `{route-<route-name>-host}` pattern, whenever you want the route URL to appear.
For example, to insert a step that asks the user of the walkthrough to log into the CakePHP app:
+
----
. Log into the link:{route-cakephp-mysql-example-host}[CakePHP app].
----
+
NOTE: If you want Asciidoc attributes to render values in code blocks, you must start the code block with `[subs="attributes"]`.

. Publish the walkthrough or redeploy the *tutorial-web-app* to pick up changes to your walkthrough.
. Log in to the Webapp using a different username to test the walkthrough.


[type=verification]
Check that the walkthrough offers the link to the service, and that it resolves.

[type=verificationFail]
Make sure you have completed all the steps.
