This walkthrough demonstrates a fault tolerant integration pattern that integrates a message driven architecture with a RESTful API architecture.

Message-oriented middleware (MOM)::
MOM allows you implement an asynchronous, routable and transformable message queue.

API-centric architecture::
Typically, a developer working on a back-end application implements a synchronous RESTful API to allow communication from other applications.

You may identify business value, as part of an application modernization effort, in integrating a message queue with an API.
This is not trivial because of the conflicting underlying timing models, and the data may require transformation to be usable.

In this walkthrough, you create a simple and intuitive integration, with built-in monitoring, to enable communication between two applications:

* A Node.js webapp provides a method to create messages, in this example, a new inventory item.
* A Spring Boot CRUD app provides a RESTful API, in this example, an inventory API.

To create this integration, you use link:{amq-url}[AMQ, window="_blank"] and API connectors in link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"].

All of the applications and services used in the walkthrough are running on Red Hat OpenShift.

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, for example, Gmail and IRC.
It can be extended with custom connectors, using either OpenAPI definitions (Swagger) or using JAR files.
To create a connector for the RESTful API, you register the OpenAPI definition as a Customization.

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console.

. Select *Customizations* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create API Connector* button to start the *API Client Connector* wizard.

. When prompted to *Upload OpenAPI Specification*, select *Use a URL*:
.. Enter the following in the URL field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{route-crud-url}

.. Click *Next*.

. When prompted with *Review Actions*, select *Next*.

. When prompted with *Specify Security*, select *Next*.

. When prompted with *Review/Edit Connector Details*:
.. Enter the following in the *Connector Name* field:

.. Click *Create API Connector*.

[type=verification]
Check the *Customizations* screen of the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console to make sure the new connector exists.

=== Creating HTTP connection to CRUD App

To enable Fuse Online to send messages from the queue to the Spring Boot CRUD app, you create a connection in Red Hat Fuse Online using the API connector you just created.


. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console.

. Select *Connections* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create Connection* button to start the *Create Connection* wizard.

. When prompted with *Select Connector*, select *Walkthrough {walkthrough-id} CRUD Connector*.

=== Creating AMQ connection in Red Hat Fuse Online

To allow Fuse Online to consume messages placed on the queue by the Node.js webapp, you create a connection in Red Hat Fuse Online using the AMQ connector.


:fuse-url: https://eval.apps.city.openshiftworkshop.com/
:openshift-url: https://master.city.openshiftworkshop.com/console/project/eval/overview
:amq: Red Hat AMQ

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank"] console.

. Select *Connections* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create Connection* button to start the *Create Connection* wizard.

. When prompted with *Select Connector*, select *AMQ Message Broker*.
+
NOTE: Avoid choosing the similarly named *AMQP Message Broker*.

. When prompted with *AMQ Message Broker Configuration*:
.. Enter the following into the *Broker URL* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
tcp://{amq-broker-tcp-url}:61616
----

.. Enter the username relating to {amq}:
