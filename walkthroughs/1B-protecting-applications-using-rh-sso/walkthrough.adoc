= Protecting Applications using Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO)

This Solution Pattern demonstrates how to use the end user SSO instance to protect web applications using standards such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.

For more information about the various SSO instances in a Managed Integration cluster, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_managed_integration/1/html-single/getting_started/index#sso[Managed Integration documentation].

NOTE: You must complete the *Integrating message-oriented middleware with a RESTful API using AMQ Online* Solution Pattern before starting this Solution Pattern.


This Solution Pattern shows you how to use the *{customer-sso-name}* to enable
authentication and authorisation for the *Order Entry System* and the *Order
Management System* from the *Integrating message-oriented middleware with a
RESTful API using AMQ Online* Solution Pattern.

== Creating a client and user in SSO

SSO uses *Realms* to manage *Clients*, *Roles*, *Users* and *Groups*. A
user belongs to and logs into a realm. Realms are isolated from one another and
can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

A realm has already been created for this Solution Pattern and user.

=== Creating a Client

Securing an application using SSO requires a *Client* to be created in
a *Realm*. The *Client* represents the application being secured and contains
important details regarding the security applied to the application.

. Navigate to the link:{sso-realm-url}[SSO Realm, window="_blank"].
. Enter the username `{user-username}` and password `password` if prompted.
. Details for the `{user-username}` realm are displayed upon login success.
. Select *Clients* from the menu on the left.
. Click the *Create* button at the top of the list of clients to display the *Add Client* screen:
.. Enter `order-entry-system` in the *Client ID* field.
.. Verify *Client Protocol* is set to `openid-connect`.
.. Paste the URL of the *Order Entry System UI* from the *Integrating message-oriented middleware with a RESTful API using AMQ Online* Solution Pattern in the *Root URL* field. This should look similar to `https://order-entry-ui-{user-username}-<NAMESPACE>.{openshift-app-host}`
.. Click *Save*.
. The *Settings* screen for the `order-entry-system` client should be displayed.
. Verify that the *Access Type* field is set to `public`. This means the client is a frontend application that needs to login via a web browser.

[type=verification]
Select the *Clients* item in the side menu. 
Is the `order-entry-system` client listed and *Enabled* set to `True`?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above and that the *Enabled* toggle in the *Client* is set to *ON*. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

=== Creating a User

Red Hat Single Sign-On provides identity brokering functionality, which facilitates login using a shared identity. For example, it is possible
to create an *Identity Provider* in a *Realm* in SSO to enable login
using social identities such as Google, Twitter, or GitHub. When the user
chooses to login using an *Identity Provider* a *User* is automatically created
in the SSO *Realm* with the details from their chosen
*Identity Provider*.

In this Solution Pattern a *User* will be created manually to keep things
simple.

. Navigate to the link:{sso-realm-url}[SSO Realm, window="_blank"].
. Enter the username `{user-username}` and password `password` if prompted.
. Select the *Users* entry in the side menu.
. Click *Add user*.
.. Enter the username `customer`.
.. Leave other fields with their default values and click *Save*.
. The `customer` user details should now be displayed with tabs along the top of the UI.
. Select the *Credentials* tab.
.. Enter the password `customer-password` in the *New Password* field.
.. Enter the same password in the *Password Confirmation* field.
.. Set the *Temporary* toggle to the *OFF* position.
+
NOTE: If we left *Temporary* in the *ON* position the user would be forced to create a new password when they perform a login.
.. Click the *Reset Password* button.
.. When prompted click the *Change password* button in the modal.

[type=verification]
Select the *Users* item in the side menu. Click the *View all users* button. Is the `customer` user listed?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

== Enabling SSO in the Order Entry System

=== Obtaining the SSO Configuration

To secure an application with SSO a *Client Adapter* is required.
Various platforms are supported with *Client Adapters*:

* Spring Boot
* Node.js
* JBoss EAP
* Fuse
* JavaScript (client-side)
* Servlet Filter

{blank}

The *Order Entry System* is run from a Node.js server, so the Node.js
`keycloak-connect` adapter is included in the code. The following steps will
demonstrate how to include a configuration and enable the adapter.


. Navigate to the link:{sso-realm-url}[SSO Realm, window="_blank"].
. Enter the username `{user-username}` and password `password` if prompted. 
. Select *Clients* from the side menu.
. Click the `order-entry-system` client that was created earlier.
. Choose the *Installation* tab.
. Select *Keycloak OIDC JSON* for *Format Option*.
. Click the *Download* button to download this as a _keycloak.json_ file.

=== Creating a SSO Config Map Entry

. Login to the link:{openshift-host}/console/[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select the project that contains *walkthroughs-1A-integrate-event-and-api-driven-apps* in the name.
. Select *Resources > Config Maps*.
. Click the *Create Config Map*  button.
.. Enter `order-entry-keycloak-config` in the *Name* field.
.. Enter `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG` in the *Key* field.
.. Click the *Browse* button and select the _keycloak.json_ file that was downloaded in the previous section.
. Click the *Create* button.

=== Applying the SSO Config Map

. Log in to the link:{openshift-host}/console/[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Navigate to the *walkthroughs-1A-integrate-event-and-api-driven-apps* project.
. Select *Applications > Deployments*.
. Select the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* item from the *Deployments* list.
. Select the *Environment* tab.
.. Click *Add Value from Config Map or Secret*
.. Enter `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG` in the *Name* column.
.. Choose `order-entry-keycloak-config` from the *Select a resource* dropdown.
.. Choose `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG` in the *Select key* dropdown. 
. Scroll down and click *Save*.
. Select *Overview* on the left and find the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* in the list.
. If a deployment is still in progress, wait for it to finish.
. Open the URL listed beside the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* in either a private browser session, or a different browser to view the *Order Entry System* UI.
+
NOTE: Use a private session or different browser to avoid conflict with old sessions.

. A login screen with the title *{user-username} Realm* is displayed.
. Enter `customer` in the *Username or email*.
. Enter `customer-password` in the *Password* field.
. Click the *Log In* button.

[type=verification]
The login should be successful. Is the *Order Entry System* web application displayed?

[type=verificationFail]
If a login page is not presented try opening the *Order Entry System* in a private browsing session or different browser.
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.
