= Managing and protecting APIs using API management

:context: integrating-api-driven-applications

This Solution Pattern demonstrates how an API can be protected and rate limited.

Organizations modernizing their applications typically create many APIs.
It then becomes paramount to understand the usage of these APIs and to ensure they are protected, for example, from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
It is possible to protect and limit access to APIs as part of an integration.

In this walkthrough, you use the Fuse Aggregation App, which is a demonstration app that provides data using an API.
The Solution Pattern shows how to deploy, edit, protect and rate-limit that API, using OpenShift, {launcher-service}, {code-ready-service} and {api-mgmt-service}.

== Running the Fuse Aggregation App

=== Deploying the Fuse Aggregation App

The Fuse Aggregation App provides information about flights. You deploy it using Launcher.

// TODO placeholders for product names
// TODO append /launch/wizard/<project-name> to launcher url
// TODO flights endpoint url
. Log in to the link:{launcher-url}/launch/wizard/{walkthrough-namespace}[{launcher-service}, window="_blank", id="{context}-1"] wizard.

. Select the option to *Build and Deploy Online* in the *Target Environment* step.

. Click the *Authorize* button to allow Launcher create resources in the OpenShift cluster. This triggers an OAuth flow and eventually redirects back to the {launcher-service} wizard.

. Click the blue down-arrow icon to continue.

. Select the *Aggregation* mission and *Fuse* runtime in the *Mission & Runtime* step

. Click the blue down-arrow icon to continue.

. Authorize your Github Account
.. Click the *Log In & Authorize Account* button in the *Authorize Git Provider* step.
.. This opens a Github OAuth page.
.. Click the *Authorize <organisation/user>* button at the bottom.
.. You will be redirected back to the {launcher-service} wizard.

. Click all the blue down-arrow icons to continue.

. Click the *Set Up Application* button to create a Git repository and provision the mission resources to OpenShift. A build for the Fuse Aggregation App is triggered and deployed.

====
Check that the following pods are running in the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}[OpenShift Project, window="_blank", id="{context}-2"]:

* fuse-flights-aggregator
* arrivals
* departures

Are the pods running?

.. Click the *Add* button to add the repository to the workspace.
.. Click the *Create & Open* button at the bottom.
.. Click *Open in IDE*.
+
. Open the file at *src/main/java/com/redhat/fuse/boosters/rest/http/CamelRouter.java*.
+
// TODO: explain what the app is doing and why we're modifying it
+
. Comment out the routing code that talks to local java services.
.. Navigate to the section of the file with a comment of `// COMMENT OUT THIS`.
.. Comment out the line of code below this using double slashes *//*.
+
. Uncomment the routing code that talks to remote services.
.. Navigate to the section of the file with a comment of `// UNCOMMENT THIS`.
.. Uncomment the line of code below this by removing the double slashes.

. Commit and push the changes back to the repository:
.. Select the *Git* menu, then *Commit*.
.. Ensure the *CamelRouter.java* file is checked.
.. Enter a commit message of *Switch to remote services* in the input area.
.. Check the box for *Push commited changes to* and ensure the branch is set to *master*.
.. Click the *Commit* button.
.. A green notification *Pushed to Origin* is displayed.
.. A new build is triggered in OpenShift and the new changes are rolled out to the Fuse Aggregation App.
