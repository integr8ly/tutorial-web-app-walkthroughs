= Managing and protecting APIs using API management

:context: integrating-api-driven-applications

This walkthrough demonstrates how an API can be protected and rate limited.

Organizations modernizing their applications typically create many APIs.
It then becomes paramount to understand the usage of these APIs and to ensure they are protected, for example, from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
It is possible to protect and limit access to APIs as part of an integration.

In this walkthrough, you use the *Fuse Aggregation App*, which is a demonstration app that provides data using an API.
The walkthrough shows how to deploy, edit, protect and rate-limit that API, using OpenShift, {launcher-service}, {code-ready-service} and {api-mgmt-service}.

== Deploying the Fuse Aggregation App

The Fuse Aggregation App provides information about flights. You deploy it using Launcher.

// TODO placeholders for product names
// TODO append /launch/wizard/<project-name> to launcher url
// TODO flights endpoint url
. Log in to the link:{launcher-url}/launch/wizard/{walkthrough-namespace}[{launcher-service}, window="_blank"] wizard.

. Select the option to *Code Locally, Build and Deploy* in the *Select Target Environment* step.

. Select the *Authorize* button to allow Launcher create resources in the OpenShift cluster. This triggers an OAuth flow, and eventually redirects back to the {launcher-service} wizard.

. Select the blue down-arrow icon to continue the wizard.

. Select the *Aggregation* mission and *Fuse* runtime in the *Select Mission & Runtime* step

. Select the blue down-arrow icon to continue the wizard.

. Authorize your Github Account
.. Select the *Log In & Authorize Account* button in the *Authorize Git Provider* step.
.. This opens a Github OAuth page.
.. Select the *Authorize <organisation/user>* button at the bottom.
.. You will be redirected back to the {launcher-service} wizard.

. Select all blue down-arrow icons to continue the wizard, accepting the git repository name.

. Select the *Set Up Application* button to create a Git repository and provision the mission resources to OpenShift. A build for the *Fuse Aggregation App* is triggered and deployed.


[type=verification]
. Are the following pods running in the link:{openshift-host}/console/project/{walkthrough-namespace}[OpenShift Project, window="_blank"]:
+
* fuse-flights-aggregator
+
* arrivals
+
* departures
// TODO: flights api links to /camel/flights
. Navigate to the link:{route-fuse-flights-aggregator-host}/camel/flights[Flights Endpoint, window="_blank"] and check that the response includes details about 8 flights.

== Modifying the Fuse Aggregation App

Modify the Fuse Aggregation App to aggregate flights data from the Arrivals & Deparatures servers


// TODO placeholders for product names
// TODO project name
. Log in to the link:{che-url}[Code Ready, window="_blank"] Dashboard

. The *New Workspace* page is displayed. Create a new Workspace:
.. Use the *Java 1.8* stack.
.. Select the *Add or Import Project* button.

.. Select the *Add* button to add the repository to the workspace.
.. Select the *Create* button at the bottom.
.. Select *Open in IDE*.
+
. Open the file at *src/main/java/com/redhat/fuse/boosters/rest/http/CamelRouter.java*.
+
// TODO: explain what the app is doing and why we're modifying it
+
. Comment out the routing code that talks to local java services.
.. Navigate to the section of the file with a comment of `// COMMENT OUT THIS`.
.. Comment out the line of code below this using double slashes *//*.
+
. Uncomment the routing code that talks to remote services.
.. Navigate to the section of the file with a comment of `// UNCOMMENT THIS`.
.. Uncomment the line of code below this by removing the double slashes.
+
. Before the changes can be commited and pushed to the repository, you must specify a name and email to associate with commits:
.. Select the *Profile* menu, then *Preferences*.
.. Choose the *Commiter* option under the *Git* heading.
.. Set a *Name* and *Email*.
.. Select *Save* then *Close*.

. Commit and push the changes back to the repository:
.. Select the *Git* menu, then *Commit*.
.. Ensure the *CamelRouter.java* file is checked.
.. Enter a commit message of *Switch to remote services* in the input area.
.. Check the box for *Push commited changes to* and ensure the branch is set to *master*.
.. Select the *Commit* button.
.. A green notification *Pushed to Origin* is displayed.
.. A new build will be triggered in OpenShift and rollout the new changes to the *Fuse Aggregation App*.
