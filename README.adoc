= Integreatly walkthroughs

This repository contains the walkthroughs automatically included with the [Tutorial Web App](https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app). They are curated by the Integreatly team.
Typically, a core walkthrough has the following attributes:

* A clear user story that addresses an integration goal
* Contains a diagram that represents the user flow and the components used in the walkthrough
* Each task is timed appropriately
* Each task starts with the appropriate console (to support users returning to a walkthrough)
* Each step has a validation section
* Each asciidoc attribute resolves to a value
