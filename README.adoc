= Integreatly Solution Patterns

This repository contains the Solution Patterns automatically included with the link:https://github.com/integr8ly/tutorial-web-app[Solution Explorer]. They are curated by the Integreatly team.
Typically, a core Solution Pattern has the following attributes:

* A clear user story that addresses an integration goal
* Contains a diagram that represents the user flow and the components used in the Solution Pattern
* Each task is timed appropriately
* Each task starts with the appropriate console (to support users returning to a Solution Pattern)
* Each step has a validation section
* Each asciidoc attribute resolves to a value
